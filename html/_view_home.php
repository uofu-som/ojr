<p>This tool is to gather information on the versions of Java running on machines that you manage.</p>
<p>The assumption is that you have some way to distribute and run scripts on the various machines you administer. There are 2 scripts, one PowerShell for Operating Systems like Microsoft Windows and the other is a bash script for *inux-based machines.</p>
<p>These scripts do their best to search the filesystems for Java binaries. We make various assumptions in searching for them and as such are subject to missing some that fall outside these assumptions.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
<p>This tools is not an end-all nor authoritative but a tool to help as a starting point to addressing Oracle Java Licensing requirements.</p>
